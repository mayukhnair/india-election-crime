Will India vote for a criminal or a crorepati again in 2019? 

For a population of 1.3 billion, the Lok Sabha currently admits only 543 representatives. This only further intensifies the competition for being elected Member of Parliament to the sanctum sanctorum of Indian democracy. Being elected MP brings with the role serious power dynamics and influence over a sizeable populace. 

To achieve this legitimate authority is an attraction for many, some of whom seem to indulge in unfair competition. Declarations made to the Election Commission of India (ECI) by candidates prior to the 2014 general election highlight a worrying fact about Indian politics: that it is further coming under the control of candidates with criminal allegations, or excess wealth to spare.

A data-driven, visualized analysis of the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections has much to show.

## Candidate insights: 2009 Lok Sabha Elections 

Most Lok Sabha candidates are not serious contenders, hence only candidates having a vote share exceeding 20% were considered. 149 out of the now defined total of 1162 candidates have been booked for a serious criminal charge.

### Criminals Running for Office

Candidates from Uttar Pradesh eclipse all other states in terms of criminality, with 50 candidates facing a criminal charges. This is followed by Maharashtra, Bihar and Gujarat (17, 16 and 11 respectively). 

Party-wise, the BJP fielded 35 criminal candidates, followed by INC at 26 and BSP with 22.

</div>


423 of the 1162 candidates reported themselves as having a postgraduate degree. The Congress has the highest number of postgraduates with 142 candidates, with the BJP at a distant 84, followed by the CPM (31) and BSP (30). By state, Uttar Pradesh leads with 72 post-graduates, ahead of Andhra Pradesh (44) and West Bengal (35).


Of candidates with criminal allegations, 41 possess a postgraduate degree. Uttar Pradesh leads the list with 16 postgraduate criminal candidates, followed by Bihar (5). The southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, along with Haryana have 3 candidates each.

### Wealth and Assets

The data on wealth is tricky, because asset declarations may be underreported. Alternatively, assets might be in the name of the candidate’s family members and not register in the affidavits at all.

  <small> Use the drop-down filter on the map above to see the average movable asset worth per candidate, criminals re-elected and concentration of postgraduate candidates - all of them measured by state. Data:<br>Trivedi Centre for Political Data, Ashoka University</small>
</div>

On an average, candidates from regional parties match candidates from national parties with their declared movable assets (money, jewellery, vehicles). Candidates from Karnataka’s Janata Dal (Secular) have average movable assets at Rs. 4.79 crore, followed by Nationalist Congress Party with Rs. 4.3 crore, and Congress with Rs 3.4 crore. 


The BJP ranks below 13 parties with an average value of Rs 1.44 crore. By state, these parties’ respective home states actually rank lower. Himachal Pradesh leads with an average of Rs 14.98 cr, followed by Andhra Pradesh (Rs 7.52 cr) and Haryana (Rs 6.67 cr).


## The 2014 Comparative: Renomination and Reelection


Of the 542 Lok Sabha winners in 2009, a comparison of candidates with criminal charges against those with none reveals much more. Of the 455 non-criminals elected to the Lok Sabha in 2009, 235 were re-nominated by their parties to contest in 2014. 115 of these people went on to win a seat in 2014 as well, representing a 51% re-nomination rate and 49% success rate. 


Contrast this with the prospects of candidates facing criminal charges. 87 such candidates got elected in 2009, of which 50 got re-nominated, yielding a re-nomination rate of 58%. Further, 28 went on to win in the 2014 elections, at a 56% success rate.

While the impact of criminality is not very significant, data shows that more incumbent criminals retain their seat than their non-criminal peers. 


### Party and State wise Renomination, Reelection

BJP managed to get the maximum number of criminal MPs reelected. It can be attributed to the ‘Modi Wave’ phenomenon of 2014 that aided Narendra Modi's campaign. It is likely that the strong anti-incumbency sentiment against the Congress combined with Modi's popularity may have compensated for the tainted personal records of BJP’s candidates.

<div align="center">
  <small>Renominated and re-elected criminal candidates by party. Data:<br>Trivedi Centre for Political Data, Ashoka University</small>
</div>

The Modi Wave phenomenon is corroborated by the BJP relative numbers compared to their competitors. BJP renominated 20 criminal candidates in 2014, compared to the Congress’ 9 and AITC’s 3. The Congress’ success rate was 33% for their criminal candidates (3 out of 9 reelections), while the BJP’s number is 80% (16/20). 


It is interesting to note that AITC’s is 100% (3/3), and their stronghold is West Bengal, where BJP’s presence is minimal. This could have possibly insulated them from the Modi Wave. BJP managed to get most criminal candidates reelected from UP and Gujarat, where Modi was highly popular.


5 states constitute the bulk of where candidates with criminal charges manage to get reelected in 2014. Bihar (3), Gujarat, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh (4 each) have the highest concentration of such candidates, with a few other states having 1 candidate. This is not surprising since the maximum number of criminals candidates contest elections from these states. 

## Why does India elect them?

India’s population makes the elections a costly exercise for political parties. [Expenditure filings with the ECI for the 2014 general elections](https://eci.gov.in/files/category/273-recognized-national-parties/) state that six national parties spent a combined Rs 1372.7 crores.  BJP's successful campaign cost them Rs 714.28 cr, while Congress spent Rs 516.02 cr.  

This steep cost has led to parties favouring candidates with deep pockets for financing their campaign. The further the candidate’s ability to self-finance their campaign, the lesser he/she will be draining the party’s coffers.Candidates with criminal charges have greater wealth, which furthers their chance of getting a party’s ticket. 

In India, the trend for criminal candidates’ prospects is anything but bleak. [In a BBC interview](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-38607255), political scientist Milan Vaishnav stated that Indian voters are swayed on communal and religious lines, which is further used to highlight the failing of the present government to deliver to its citizens. Criminal candidates not only utilize this to full effect, they often use their known criminal power as political leverage.

This is combined with the government's wilful apathy to protect dubious funding channels for their parties. [The Lok Sabha recently passed a bill](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-bill-to-exempt-political-parties-from-scrutiny-on-foreign-funds-without-debate/article23285764.ece) that exempts parties from scrutiny of funds received from abroad, that too sans debate. And new rules shown by the government to "clean up" funding only makes it murkier: the Union Budget of 2017-18 introduced electoral bonds to crack down on cash donations, [but allowed anonymity of donors.](https://adrindia.org/content/india%E2%80%99s-political-funding-mess)

The Supreme Court [recently struck down petitions to bar criminal candidates](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-netas-facing-criminal-cases-contest-elections-supreme-court-to-to-decide-soon/story-1Wu3771SusfAsUUu4eDatJ.html) from contesting elections, but underlined that it is time Parliament enacts laws to prevent this. But as the information goes to show, India is doing anything but cleaning up.
