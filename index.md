Will India vote for a criminal or a crorepati again in 2019? Let’s look at 2009-14 to find out.

Looking back at the previous election cycle (2009-14), candidates with serious criminal charges show greater political longevity, and a better chance of returning to office.

Most Lok Sabha candidates are not serious contenders, hence we only consider candidates with more than 20% vote share. This shrinks our 2009 candidate dataset to 1162 candidates and 37 political parties. Criminal candidates are candidates facing serious criminal charges. 

## Criminals Running for Office, 2009

Candidates from Uttar Pradesh eclipse all other states in terms of criminality, with 50 candidates
facing a criminal charges. This is followed by Maharashtra, Bihar and Gujarat (17, 16 and 11 respectively). 


Party-wise, the BJP fielded 35 criminal candidates, followed by INC at 26 and BSP with 22.

## Education, 2009

423 of the 1162 candidates reported themselves as having a postgraduate degree. The Congress has the highest number of postgraduates with 142 candidates, with the BJP at a distant 84, followed by the CPM (31) and BSP (30). By state, Uttar Pradesh leads with 72 post-graduates, ahead of Andhra Pradesh (44) and West Bengal (35).


Our criminals are not entirely uneducated. Of candidates with criminal allegations, 41 possess a postgraduate degree. Uttar Pradesh leads the list with 16 postgraduate criminal candidates, followed by Bihar (5). The southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, along with Haryana have 3 candidates each.

## Wealth and Assets, 2009

The data on wealth is tricky, because asset declarations may be underreported. Alternatively, assets might be in the name of the candidate’s family members and not register in the affidavits at all. *party assets*

On an average, candidates from regional parties match candidates from national parties with their declared movable assets (money, jewellery, vehicles). Candidates from Karnataka’s Janata Dal (Secular) have average movable assets at Rs. 4.79 crore, followed by Nationalist Congress Party with Rs. 4.3 crore, and Congress with Rs 3.4 crore. 


The BJP ranks below 13 parties with an average value of Rs 1.44 crore. By state, these parties’ respective home states actually rank lower. Himachal Pradesh leads with an average of Rs 14.98 cr, followed by Andhra Pradesh (Rs 7.52 cr) and Haryana (Rs 6.67 cr).


## The 2014 Comparative: Renomination and Reelection


Of the 542 Lok Sabha winners in 2009, 285 got re-nominated by their parties to contest the 2014 elections. This gives us a 52% re-nomination rate. Of these 285, 143 won the election again in 2014, This is roughly a 50% success rate - the percentage of renominations who successfully secured reelection. 


A comparison of candidates with criminal charges against those with none reveals much more. Of the 455 non-criminals elected to the Lok Sabha in 2009, 235 were re-nominated by their parties to contest in 2014. 115 of these people went on to win a seat in 2014 as well, representing a 51% re-nomination rate and 49% success rate. 


Contrast this with the prospects of candidates facing criminal charges. 87 such candidates got elected in 2009, of which 50 got re-nominated, yielding a re-nomination rate of 58%. Further, 28 went on to win in the 2014 elections, at a 56% success rate.

While the impact of criminality is not very significant, data shows that more incumbent criminals retain their seat than their non-criminal peers. 


These candidates are preferred more by the parties than the electorate. Political scientist Milan Vaishnav notes in an interview with BBC that criminal and wealthy candidates self-finance their campaigns, which is beneficial for parties as the party coffers are not depleted. These candidates may even contribute to the party fund to sponsor other candidates’ campaigns. 


## Party and State wise Renomination, Reelection


Of the 28 candidates with criminal charges reelected in 2014, an overwhelming majority of them are from the BJP (16 candidates). Trinamool Congress (AITC) and INC’s count is 3 and 2  respectively, with a bunch of regional parties like SP, JD(U), ADMK, AIMIM, CPM having 1 candidate each. 


The reason for the BJP getting the maximum number of candidates with criminal cases re-elected can also be attributed to the ‘Modi Wave’ of 2014. It is likely that the strong anti-incumbency sentiment against the Congress, as well as the popularity of Narendra Modi in 2014 may have compensated for the tainted personal records of BJP’s candidates.

<div align="center">

</div>

The Modi Wave phenomenon is corroborated by the BJP relative numbers compared to their competitors. BJP renominated 20 criminal candidates in 2014, compared to the Congress’ 9 and AITC’s 3. The Congress’ success rate was 33% for their criminal candidates (3 out of 9 reelections), while the BJP’s number is 80% (16/20). 


It is interesting to note that AITC’s is 100% (3/3), and their stronghold is West Bengal, where BJP’s presence is minimal, possibly insulating them from the Modi Wave.


5 states constitute the bulk of where candidates with criminal charges manage to get reelected in 2014. Bihar (3), Gujarat, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh (4 each) have the highest concentration of such candidates, with a few other states having 1 candidate. This is not surprising since the maximum number of criminals candidates contest elections from these states anyways.
